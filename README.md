# Sneakers app


This repository source code for sneakers app

* First page will contain list of sneakers in a recycler with Grid layout manager.
* If we click on any item, it will redirect to the details page, which has details of shoes and also add to cart button.
* After adding all items you can check them in the cart and also can do checkout.


* Used Room Database for DB handling, as of now I have just used Activities for every screen.
